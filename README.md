# YPIT Project

Welcome to the YPIT (Young People in Tech) project repository! This project is focused on rebuilding the Young People in Tech website to provide an engaging, informative, and accessible platform for young individuals interested in technology. Using modern web technologies like Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, we aim to create a dynamic and responsive site that serves as a resource and community hub for aspiring tech professionals.

## About the Project

The YPIT project is designed to empower young people by providing them with the tools, knowledge, and community support necessary to pursue careers in technology. By rebuilding the website, we're enhancing its functionality, user experience, and accessibility, making technology more approachable and inspiring for the next generation. This project is built in Typescript using Next.js & Tailwind CSS and hosted using Vercel.
